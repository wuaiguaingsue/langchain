    "# SalesGPT - 具有知识库和生成 Stripe 支付链接能力的上下文感知 AI 销售助手\n",
    "\n",
    "本笔记本演示了一个具有产品知识库且能够实际完成销售的**上下文感知** AI 销售代理的实现。\n",
    "\n",
    "本笔记本最初由 [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky) 在 [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) 发布。\n",
    "\n",
    "SalesGPT 具有上下文感知能力，这意味着它可以理解销售对话所处的阶段并做出相应的行动。\n",
    " \n",
    "因此，该代理可以与潜在客户进行自然的销售对话，并根据对话阶段来调整行为。因此，本笔记本演示了如何使用 AI 来自动化销售开发代表的活动，比如外呼销售。\n",
    "\n",
    "此外，AI 销售代理可以访问工具，使其能够与其他系统交互。\n",
    "\n",
    "在这里，我们展示了 AI 销售代理如何使用**产品知识库**来讨论特定公司的产品，\n",
    "从而提高相关性并减少幻觉。\n",
    "\n",
    "此外，我们还展示了我们的 AI 销售代理如何通过与 AI 代理高速公路 [Mindware](https://www.mindware.co/) 集成来**产生销售**。实际上，这使得代理能够自主为您的客户生成通过 Stripe 支付产品的**支付链接**。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们在此实现中利用了 [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) 库，特别是 [自定义代理配置](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval)，并受到 [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) 架构的启发。"
